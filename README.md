Here is a brief introduction of  some of the components involved:

𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆
An API Gateway (AG) is a server that acts as a single point of entry for a set of #microservices. AG receives client requests, forwards them to the appropriate microservice, and then returns the server's response to the client. AG is responsible for tasks such as routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that are deployed in multiple locations around the world. These servers are designed to deliver web content, such as images, videos, and other static files, to users based on their geographical location. The main purpose of a #cdn is to improve the performance and availability of web content by caching it on servers that are closer to the users who are requesting it.


𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴
In a database, 𝗵𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴, also known as sharding, involves dividing the rows of a table into smaller tables and storing them on different servers or database instances. This is done to distribute the load of a database across multiple servers and to improve performance.

On the other hand, 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 involves dividing the columns of a table into separate tables. This is done to reduce the number of columns in a table and to improve the performance of queries that only access a small number of columns.


𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 
These are used to send messages between distributed components of a system. Examples include Apache #kafka and #rabbitmq.


𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀
These are file systems that are designed to store and manage files across a group of servers.


𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺
These are used to send notifications or alerts to users, such as emails, push notifications, or text messages. 


𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵
Full-text search enables users to search for specific words or phrases within an app or website. When a user queries, the app or website returns the most relevant results. To do this quickly and efficiently, full-text search relies on an inverted index, which is a data structure that maps words or phrases to the documents in which they appear.

## 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀: 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗖𝗗𝗡?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that are deployed in multiple locations around the world. These servers are designed to deliver web content, such as images, videos, and other static files, to users based on their geographical location.

The main purpose of a CDN is to improve the performance and availability of web content by caching it on servers that are closer to the users who are requesting it. This reduces the distance that data has to travel over the internet, which can improve the speed and responsiveness of the website or application.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗽 𝟱 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗖𝗗𝗡𝘀:

1) 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀: By caching content on servers located closer to the end-users, CDNs can significantly improve the speed at which web pages and other contents load. This can lead to a better user experience and increased engagement.

2) 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰: CDNs can handle large amounts of traffic and reduce the load on the origin server. This can help prevent outages and ensure that the website or application remains available to users even during periods of high traffic.

3) 𝗗𝗗𝗼𝗦 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: CDNs can help protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by distributing traffic across multiple servers and reducing the load on a single server.

4) 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: CDNs can also provide security features such as SSL/TLS encryption and protection against malicious traffic.

5) 𝗚𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆: CDNs can deliver content to users around the world by caching it on servers in multiple locations. This can improve the performance and availability of content for users in different regions.
